I mostly prototype in Unity and Godot. I've been known to play around in UPBGE but haven't used it with much regularity. It's the continuation of the Blender game engine. I've used Blender since around the turn of the century so it's one of my all time favorite apps. I'm not a great artist but my mind wants to think it is. Mostly due to lack of practice and interest. Probaly too much dissociation and living in my own head most of the time.

I mostly use Unity and Godot but also have worked in C/C++ when learning how to program. I used to use DarkBasic and it's GDK. When I had an amiga I was using Amiga BASIC.

I focus on simulations and a lot of low level type mentality when coding but I love the higher level stuff that does everything boring for you as well. I like to make life simulations. I love survival and creative sandbox type games. Factory games are amazing as well as farming. Minecraft is nice. I'm also into Eroge type games, but only read that part if you are over the age of 18.
